## About Me

I am currently pursuing an M.Sc. in Statistics and Data Science from NMIMS Mumbai. With a strong foundation in statistics, programming, and analytics, I focus on solving real-world problems using data. My interests lie at the intersection of machine learning, NLP, and business intelligence. I enjoy building models and dashboards that deliver clarity, impact, and insight.

## Projects

**Adverse Drug Reaction Detection Using Deep Learning NLP**  
- Fine-tuned BioBERT, ClinicalBERT, and SciBERT on Twitter data to detect adverse drug events.  
- Achieved F1-scores of 85% (drug names) and 70% (adverse effects).  
- Built a transformer-based pipeline using NER and BERTopic with a 69.6% match to FDA data.

**Tail Risk Prediction of Solana: An EVT Approach**  
- Applied Generalized Extreme Value distribution to model extreme losses in Solana returns.  
- Calculated 95% VaR (5.3%) and Expected Shortfall (75.7%) for extreme risk assessment.

**Predicting Early Hospital Readmission of Diabetes Patients**  
- Developed models using Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.  
- Best model (XGBoost): 93% Accuracy, AUC of 0.96, and Recall of 0.87.  
- Used SMOTE for class imbalance and advanced feature engineering.
